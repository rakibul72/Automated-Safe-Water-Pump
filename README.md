# Automated-Safe-Water-Pump
CSE 3216: Microcontroller Based System Design Lab

#Objective:
The main objective is to reduce wastage of water by preventing overflow of water from the tank. It can be used to automate the pumping process so that people don’t need to pay extra attention about pumping water. It will help users to reduce electric bills by automatically shutting down the pump as soon as the tank is filled out. It will let users to know the current state of the water level inside the tank. It can also be used to know the amount of Dissolved Oxygen(DO) into the water.

#Social Values:
Our device will make day to day life more easier by automating the water pumping system. It will decrease the need of engaging people for this duty by automating the system. It will play an important role to save public life from the scarcity of water by reducing water wastage in the future. It will also save public from the sufferings due to sudden shortage of water. It will ensure public health safety by providing pure water.

#Required Components:
These following parts and tools are required for building this project:
• Arduino Mega2560
• 16x2 Alphaneumeric LCD
• Motor Driver
• BUZZER
• DC Motor
• IR Sensor
• Dissolved Oxygen Sensor
